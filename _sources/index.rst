	<p>Welcome to Alexa in Space!</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="http://www.css.edu/csed" target="_blank">National Center for Computer Science Education</a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Future Engineer (AFE)</a> on the Alexa for Astronauts program. As part of this partnership, we have created this Alexa in Space unit focused on programming Amazon Alexa skills in MIT App Inventor with a space-theme. In this unit, you will explore artificial intelligence (AI) concepts by creating Alexa skills. In addition, you will explore the question of how voice AI can help with space travel.</p>
