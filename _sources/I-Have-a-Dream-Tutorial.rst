    <h3>Tutorial</h3>
    <p>To get started, <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?repo=templates.appinventor.mit.edu/trincoll/csp/tutorials/aias/IHaveADreamStarter.asc" target="_blank">
    open the I Have a Dream Starter project with the embedded tutorial in MIT App Inventor</a> and login with your Google account into MIT App Inventor.
      
     Follow along with your teacher or the following video tutorial. You can also use the embedded tutorial in the template or the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bg64PZclbPwhFg8Qg2GZJw5hVC08tDIFBhs5bBbyves" target="_blank" title="">text-version of this tutorial</a> or the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x9KDcEIyXwC7_h-bRJQCe-sIuXpQTGSRUnONxMs-MLA" target="_blank">short handout</a>. </p>
     
     <p>NOTE: The video below asks you to open a starter app, but if you
      use the link above the IHaveADreamStarter app will already be loaded and you can start following the video at time 1:12. </p>

    <p><img src="../_static/assets/img/phoneIO.png" style="float:left;margin:2px" width="250px"/> 
    
    Our mobile devices and computers are built to interact with us. The mobile apps that you create will also communicate with users by getting <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Input">input</span> from the users and displaying <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Output">output</span><br/> to the users. Input  is data sent to a computer for processing by a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span>, and output is the data sent back from the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> to the device.  <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">Program</span> output is usually based on a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span>’s input or prior state (e.g., internal values or variables). Input and output can come in many forms, such as <b>tactile</b> (for example touching a button or the device vibrating), <b>audible</b> (a sound), <b>visual</b> (an image), or <b>text</b>. Try listing all the forms of input and output in the I Have a Dream app!  </p>
    <p>Designing a good <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="User Interface">user interface (UI)</span> for a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> is very important! User Experience (UX) designers are very much in demand. Most <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">programs</span> and apps these days are <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Event-driven Programming">event-driven programming</span>, which means they display the UI and wait for a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="User Events">user event</span>, for example for the user to touch a button as input.  In <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Event-driven Programming'>event-driven programming</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control.
    Events are triggered when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> is started by another application, etc., and they supply input data to a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> and trigger different blocks of code in the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> that influence its behavior.  A <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program">program</span> needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations!</p>
