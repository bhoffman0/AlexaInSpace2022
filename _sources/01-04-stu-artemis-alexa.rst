Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>During this unit, you have examined the Artemis space program and worked with 2 Alexa skills: Good Morning, Space and Space Facts. In this lesson, you will explore other contexts in which AI would be helpful in space. You will also build an Alexa skill based on your previous brainstorm.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Describe why AI could be useful in space and other contexts.</li>
		<li>Explain a function that Alexa would help with during space travel.</li>
		<li>Create a new Alexa skill using intents, utterances, and endpoint functions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Language Objectives:</strong> At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
    
    </ul>

    

Learning Activities

	<h3>Discussion: Introduction</h3>
	
	<p>In this lesson, you will be imagining how Alexa could be used in space travel. This video provides some examples of how voice AI could be used in space travel. As you watch, think about other Alexa function that could help with space travel.</p>

	<h3>Activity: Create Your Skill</h3>
	
	<p>In this activity, you will build an Alexa skill based on an idea that you have come up with in your brainstorm. Since you may be new to programming or the Alexa App Inventor environment, there are some examples of code blocks below to help you as you create your own. When you are ready, open the <a href="https://alexa.appinventor.mit.edu/?a=1#6280354029633536">New Skill starter</a>. The starter project has a skill (space helper) and intent (IntentHelpInSpace) already created for you.</p>
