Although AI has been around since the 1950s, it is widely recognized now as one of the fastest-growing fields in technology. From ELIZA to <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span>, AI has become something we interact with every day, and will be a part of our daily life for the foreseeable future. Navigation apps, 3D photography, facial recognition, and smart assistants are just a few of the everyday uses for AI, and you’ll be introduced to more examples. But how can we define AI? And why is the use of AI being extended into space?</p></td></tr>

	<h3>Discussion: Introduction</h3>
    <p>In this lesson, you will be exploring the challenges that exist in space exploration. This video will introduce you to the Artemis Space Program as well as some of the concepts you will learn in this unit. As you watch, write down some difficulties astronauts may encounter while traveling in space.</p>

	<h3>Activity: What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
    <p><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span> is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It is a process of programming a computer to make decisions for itself. This video explores the 5 big ideas associated with <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. As you watch the video, write down ways that you can identify <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>.

	<p>In this activity, you will work with a partner or group to identify which of the examples in the next activity are <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. Discuss the following questions as you complete the activity:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Does the example perceive/understand its environment?</li>
		<li>Does the example continue to learn?</li>
		<li>Does the example make plans or decisions on its own?</li>
		<li>Does the example interact with its environment?</li>
		<li>Who is doing the thinking? Where is the intelligence - with the humans who programmed it or with the device/program?</li>

	<h3>Discussion: Alexas as AI</h3>
	<p>So far in this lesson, you have defined <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">artificial intelligence</span> and explored examples of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. Sometimes, an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> technology will incorporate other <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> systems or technologies to function. In this video, you will explore how speech recognition functions in conjunction with other <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> technologies. As you watch the video, write down reasons that Amazon <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span> devices are considered to be <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>.

	<h3>New Words: Wake Words, Intents, and Utterances</h3>
	
	<p>Alexa uses <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> to build on preprogrammed skills, speech recognition, and speech synthesis to interact with humans to improve productivity. In the next lesson, you will begin exploring how you will be able to build your own <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span> skill. This video introduces some words that will be necessary to begin building your skill. As you watch the video, listen for the terms wake word, intent, and utterance.</p>

Reflection
------------

.. raw:: html
	
	<p>Now that you understand the vast capability of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> to help with productivity here on Earth, you can appreciate how this technology has the potential to be used in space.  In the next lesson, you will explore how <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> is currently being used in space and some of the ways it could be used in the future. For now, reflect on what you have learned in this lesson.</p>
