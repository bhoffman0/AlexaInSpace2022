Introduction and Goals
------------------------

.. raw:: html	
	
	<p><b>Tracing</b> is a technique used to simulate a dry run through the code or pseudocode line by line by hand  as if you are the computer executing the code. Tracing can be used for debugging or proving that your program runs correctly or for figuring out what the code actually does.  <b>Trace tables</b> can be used  to track the values of variables as they change throughout a program. To trace through code, write down a variable in each column of the trace table and keep track of its value throughout the program. Some trace tables also keep track of the output and the line number you are currently tracing.


Learning Activities

	 </p><p>For example, here is a simple algorithm that adds x to the total every time through the loop which is executed 3 times. 
	</p><pre>x ← 2
	total ← 0
	REPEAT 3 TIMES 
	{
	 total ← total + x
	}
	DISPLAY(total)
	</pre>
	<p>Try tracing through the code and see if your results match the trace table below:</p>
	<table border="">
	 <tbody><tr><th><u>x</u></th><th><u>total</u></th><th><u>Output</u></th></tr>
	 <tr><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr>
	 <tr><td></td><td>2</td></tr>
	 <tr><td></td><td>4</td></tr>
	 <tr><td></td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr>

	 <b>Writing and Tracing Pseudocode:  Critical Thinking Questions</b>

	 <p>Suppose we have a list of numbers -- e.g.,  5,  10, -2,  -3, 7,  8,  12
	 Here's an algorithm that uses sequence, selection, and iteration (repetition) to add all 
	 the <b><i>even numbers</i></b> in the list and print out their sum.
	 
	 Notice how indentation and curly brackets are used to clarify the different parts of the algorithm.</p>
	 <pre> 
	1  total ← 0      (Set total to 0)
	2  FOR EACH number IN list  
	3  {
	4     IF (EVEN(number)) 
	5     {
	6        total ← total + number    (Set total to the current total + number)
	7     }
	8  }
	9  DISPLAY(total)
	 </pre>
	
	 <p>This algorithm contains  examples of all three types of control structures, sequence, selection, and repetition.  The lines are numbered for convenience.</p>
	 <ol>
	   <li>Which line(s) of the algorithm contain a repetition control structure? Remember a control structure
	     can consist of multiple statements.
	   </li>
	   <li>Which line(s) of the algorithm contain a selection control structure?       
	   </li>
	   <li>(<b>Portfolio</b>) If you ran this algorithm on the list of numbers, 5,  10, -2,  -3, 7,  8,  12, what would it print? When tracing through an algorithm, write down the variables (total and number) and pretend you are the computer executing each line of code and change the values of the variables on your paper as needed.</li>
	   <li>(<b>Portfolio</b>) Suppose you had a list of positive numbers such as 
	     5, 10, 12, 13, 6, 7, 1, 3, 2, 1.  And suppose  for each of the numbers in the list 
	     you added the number to a running total if it is even and subtracted it if it is odd, starting the total at 0. 
	     What result would you get for this list of numbers?
	   </li>
	   <li>(<b>Portfolio</b>) Write a pseudocode algorithm that implements the algorithm you 
	     used to calculate this total. Make sure that you use AP CSP text-style pseudocode.
	   </li>
	 </ol>
