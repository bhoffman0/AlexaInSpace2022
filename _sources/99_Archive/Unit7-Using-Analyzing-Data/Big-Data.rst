Introduction and Goals

.. raw:: html

    <p>    
    We live in the information age with an exponential growth of data. In 2010 Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, said,
        "There were five exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much
        information is now created every 2 days." In 2019, the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a> estimated that "the entire digital universe is expected to reach 44
        zettabytes by 2020."</p>
		How much is an Exabyte or Zettabyte? Here is a visualization and a table from the same <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/" target="_blank">article</a> at the World Economic Forum. Click on each to view full-size versions.</p>

Learning Activities

    <p><h3>Big Data</h3>
    <p>We live in the era of Big Data which refers to data sets that are too large to fit on a normal
          computer or be processed by a standard spreadsheet or database program. Large data sets are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems (multiple computers working together to run an algorithm). Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with large data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored.
    </p>
    <p>We will explore Big Data through a number of videos from the PBS documentary, The Human Face of Big Data. We will start with a short (2:31) video, <a href="https://wdse.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/bigdata_stem_numbers_everywhere/the-human-face-of-big-data-everything-is-quantifiable/" target="_blank" title="">Everything Is Quantifiable.</a></p>

	<h3>Data Science</h3>

    <p>
    <p>The field of Data Science deals with extracting information from and visualizing the results of manipulating large
          data sets. The size of a data set affects the amount and quality of information that can be extracted from it. From this information, further analysis may yield knowledge or even wisdom. Tables, diagrams, text, and other visual tools can be used to communicate insight and knowledge gained from data. We often think of data,
          information, knowledge and wisdom forming a pyramid.
    </p>
    <div class="yui-wk-div" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="DIKW Pyramid" class="yui-img" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4169/34764532445_e3883bd446_b.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 255px;" title="DIKW Pyramid"/></div>
    <p> Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems. Computing enables new methods of deriving information from
          data, driving monumental change across many disciplines — from art to business to science. Keep the DIKW pyramid in mind as you watch the short 3 minute video, <a href="https://wdse.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/bigdata_stem_word_births/the-human-face-of-big-data-aquiring-language/" target="_blank">Learning Revealed: Acquiring Language</a>. </p>

	<h3>Bias in Data</h3>

    <p>
    <p>The path from data to information to knowledge is not always straightforward. Bias can be introduced into the
          collection and analysis of data with dangerous results. Care must be taken when collecting and analyzing data. Problems of bias are often caused by the type or source of data that is being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data. </p>
    <p>Joy Buolamwini from the MIT Media labs studies the impact of bias in face recognition systems. Watch the following video about her research.

    <!--    &lt;p&gt;In the following TEDx talk, watch for how Tricia Wang describes why &quot;Relying on Big Data alone increases the
          chances we&#39;ll miss something, while giving us the illusion we know everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;While bias in data can lead to bad business decisions like Wang describes above, it can also marginalize people. The following spoken word piece, by Joy Buolamwini, highlights the ways in which artificial intelligence can misinterpret the images of iconic black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her research Buolamwini has studied the impact of bias in current face recognition systems. In 2014, Facebook released DeepFace which significantly improved face recognition achieving a score of 97% on a standard set of faces used as a benchmark. But the faces in this benchmark turn out to be overwhelmingly white and male and DeepFace, and similar systems, performed much worse on diverse faces. Here are the results from the IBM system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
    Further research on commercial systems designed to predict the gender of any face has shown that these systems are bias towards white male faces. Existing face data sets give false sense of progress through poor representation of the undersampled majority-women and people of color&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; -->

	<h3>Big Data Activity: Exploring Data Sets</h3>
	Explore some of examples of big data and find at least two data sets that interest you. Some ideas of where to find data sets are below. Then, answer the following reflection questions in your portfolio.
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">What specifically were the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included in the data set you chose?
        </li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">What new facts did you learn when exploring the data set? List at least 3 facts.
     </li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Write a question you have about the data set you chose. Now, convert that question into a hypothesis (a statement) with your prediction about the data.
     </li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose.
     </li><li>If your data set included a visualization, explain the purpose of the visualization. How would you change or improve the visualization? If it did not include a visualization, describe one that you think would be useful in understanding the data.</li></ol>
