    <p><h3>Chapter 6: Copyright Rebalanced — An Evolution of Rights to Access the Bits</h3>
    <p>This lesson focuses on the question of use and ownership of digital media, including <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="copyright">copyrighted</span> media.  It describes how file sharing algorithms should work and discusses some of the sensational cases in the battle between large media companies and users who use file sharing sites to share music and other media.  Computing can play a role in social and political issues, which often raise legal and ethical concerns, especially if it is used to harm people.</p>
     Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization. Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use. Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property, for example by citing work that is used but not your own. The use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one’s own is plagiarism and may have legal consequences.   Here are examples of legal ways to use materials created by someone else.
	<ul>
		<li style="padding-bottom:5px"><b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='creative commons'>Creative Commons</span></b>: a public <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='copyright'>copyright</span> license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="copyright">copyrighted</span> work. This is used when the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use, and build upon the work they have created. </li>
		<li style="padding-bottom:5px"><b>Open source software:</b> programs that are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified</li>
 	    <li style="padding-bottom:5px"><b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='open access'>Open access</span> materials </b>: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='copyright'>copyright</span> or license restrictions</li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Activity 2: Open Access Impacts on Science &amp; Innovation</h3>
    Watch the video below, an interview on paywalls and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='open access'>open access</span> with NIH (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a>) Director Francis Collins and inventor Jack Andraka. (Jack Andraka was mentioned in the chapter reading as having used the academic articles Aaron Swartz released in his reseach. <a href="http://www.vancouverobserver.com/world/how-aaron-swartz-paved-way-jack-andrakas-revolutionary-cancer-test" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.) After watching the video, discuss the following questions with your classmates.
    <ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom:5px">Why was it important for Jack Andraka to have access to research articles? In what ways did he use the articles?</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom:5px">How does the NIH policy align with <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='open access'>Open Access</span> and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='creative commons'>Creative Commons</span> licenses?</li>
