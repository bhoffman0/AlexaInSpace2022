		<br><p>3a.&nbsp;This program was created in MIT App Inventor to address the issue of learning new languages. Here it teaches the user how to say different colors, where the user inputs what language it wants to hear, either Spanish or French, and then taps on a color, prompting the program to output the audio for that certain color. This allows users to quickly learn how to say colors in another language through interaction and output of audio. In the video, it shows an example of the user clicking on the Spanish checkbox and playing the audio for red and blue. The user can hear what it sounds like, and thus learn how to say it correctly. If the user accidentally inputs nolanguage or both, the program will catch the error and notify the user.</p>

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>Remember that for managing complexity, the data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code). Consider how the code would change if they were adding/removing items from the list. In this particular sample, it might be difficult to understand why this sample did not earn a point for this row. The programmer of this sample would need to add more selection statements.  Here is an example of how the sample could be <i>modified</i> to meet the criteria for this row (note that this example  could be further modified so that the hard-coded index in the else statement is removed):

The procedure “interpret_response” has a parameter and selects the response for the user based on the question and the user input. Without it, my program wouldn’t function at all. So, the program displays the question, the user interprets it and then feeds the program data, which is their response to the question. The data that the user inputs to the program is the text from the text
	box. That text is the parameter for procedure “interpret response”, in the procedure, the user's input iscalled “number of hours”. Procedure “interpret response” processes the “number of hours” and formulates an output that it will pull from the list “solution list” based on the question and the number of n hours.
	<br>The procedure uses a loop that checks what question is displayed to the user, so it can understand the parameter in the context of what question is being asked. After analyzing the question that is displayed and the “number of hours”, the procedure will pull different strings from a second list, “solutions list”. If the user indicates that they are harming the environment through the “number of hours”, the procedure will pull an output from the second list that notifies the user that they are doing harm to the environment, and give them ways to lessen their effects. Also, an image property is set to thumbs down. If “number of hours” indicates they are being good to the environment, the program will notify them and congratulate them on their safe living. Also, the image property is set to a thumbs up.</p>

The procedure “interpret_response” has a parameter and selects the response for the user based on the question and the user input. Without it, my program wouldn’t function at all. So, the program displays the question, the user interprets it and then feeds the program data, which is their response to the question. The data that the user inputs to the program is the text from the text
	box. That text is the parameter for procedure “interpret response”, in the procedure, the user's input iscalled “number of hours”. Procedure “interpret response” processes the “number of hours” and formulates an output that it will pull from the list “solution list” based on the question and the number of n hours.
	<br>The procedure uses a loop that checks what question is displayed to the user, so it can understand the parameter in the context of what question is being asked. After analyzing the question that is displayed and the “number of hours”, the procedure will pull different strings from a second list, “solutions list”. If the user indicates that they are harming the environment through the “number of hours”, the procedure will pull an output from the second list that notifies the user that they are doing harm to the environment, and give them ways to lessen their effects. Also, an image property is set to thumbs down. If “number of hours” indicates they are being good to the environment, the program will notify them and congratulate them on their safe living.

		<p>3D. If the question label is equal to the second element in “question list” and the parameter “number of hours” (equal to the text box text) is 6, then the second element in “solutions list” will be displayed on “output label” and image property will be set to badd.png. In this scenario, the question asked to the user asks how many hours their AC was on during that day. The user inputs 6 to the text box, indicating that their AC was on for 6 hours. This is where I wanted a message to display to the user that they are using their AC too much and offer them alternatives. So, I created a list with solutions and that message is the second element in “solution list”, so that is why the program pulls the second element from “solution list” and displays it on “output label” when the user inputs 6 for the question at index 2 in “questions list.
	<br>Another scenario, if the first element in “question list” is equal to the string displayed in “question label” and the text input by the user, or “number of hours”, is 1, then the fourth element in “solution list” is pulled and displayed on the output label and the image is set to “good.png”. In the context of my program, this scenario would mean the question asks how long the user had spent driving on that day. The program recognizes this is the question being asked and since the parameter is less than 3, then the program will display element 4 from “solutions list” that notifies the user that they are doing a good job and that they aren’t emitting too many fossil fuels. The user will also be encouraged to keep it up and a thumbs up image will pop up.<br></p>

	<p>The video and narration are well planned out and executed.  It is simple and yet thoroughly explains the app.
	     The two things to remember the difference between are purpose and function.  Purpose is the intended goal or 
	     objective of the program.  Function is how the program works.</p>

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>Students should take the time to explicitly describe the logical or mathematical concepts used in the design of the algorithm. This statement,

	     on it being the logical part of the algorithm.
	Great use of the phrase “the algorithm examines” points out the function of it.  To show the relation to overall program, this example uses another

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>The statement “One of the integrated algorithms…” is a great way to call attention to the requirements for this part of the scoring criteria.  
	     When it comes to the logical/mathematical concepts, this response leaves a lot to the imagination and only states “ load up the user’s diary 
	     entries if the correct password is entered”.  By explicitly stating “My program uses logic to determine…”, one can take the guesswork out of 
	     awarding points for the grader.
	
	     This example does a nice job of explaining how both procedures do their work independently, but then also connects what they do in the
