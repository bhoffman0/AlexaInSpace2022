ASSESSMENT: AP Create 2
========================

	<h3 id="est-length">Time Estimate: 12 hours (16 45 minute classes) minimum</h3>
	<p>Follow these directions if you are taking CSP as an AP course. If you are in a non-AP CSP course, please go to the next lesson for Non-AP Create directions.</p>

Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>Work with a partner to design a socially useful interactive app, that demonstrates algorithms, data, and procedural abstractions. Although you may start your project together, some of your algorithms must be developed independently. As you develop your project keep track of significant errors and bugs that you encountered and how you solved or debugged them in a journal. Be sure to follow an iterative process when developing your app.
	</p>
	
	<p>Before beginning, please review the following:

	<h3>Warm Up Activity: Create Grading Rubric</h3>
	<p>
	Use the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-2021-create-performance-task-scoring-guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" title="">Create Performance Task Scoring Guidelines </a> to grade the two <a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/unit?unit=127&amp;lesson=203" target="_blank">Create Performance Task Samples in lesson 8.9</a> to familiarize yourself with the rubric and Create write-ups.</p>
	
	<h3>Iterative Design Thinking Process</h3>

	<p>Use an Iterative Design Thinking Process to develop your app. The following outline is an example of how you could apply the design thinking process to the development of your Create project. Each iteration should include stepping through the applicable Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test stages. Additional information about each iteration is provided below the outline.<br>

	<h3>Iteration 1: Paper Prototype</h3>
	<p>Before you start creating your app in MIT App Inventor, you will brainstorm ideas on paper with a partner and present an elevator pitch to your class. When brainstorming, keep in mind that for the Create 2 project, your project should use a List and if needed a database like TinyDB for handling data, as well as procedures with parameters that you have defined and sequence, selection, and iteration. Complete the following:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>
	    Description of Problem [Empathize, Define, and Ideate]:</b> Working in pairs, think about problems in your community and how an app might help to solve those problems or to help people in your community. Who is the target audience or users who will be using the app? What problem does the app address? How does the app address the problem? What data might your app need? What data would the app need as input and provide as output?</li>
	<li><span class="yui-non"><b>Paper Prototypes [Prototype]:</b> Create <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1M-DZITeDT9aiPZ7Oz-kXKEGkn0DiFOH1i8idBNlxwCA/copy" target="_blank" title="">paper prototypes</a> of three different ideas from your brainstorm. Describe what each UI element will do. Clearly label input and output.</span></li>
	<li><b>Elevator Pitch:</b> Present a short (2-3 minute) elevator pitch of your project idea to the class. The pitch could follow this template:
	[name of app] is a [kind of thing] for [the people who would use it] and [problem it would solve] that, unlike [similar apps] is able to [the major distinguishing feature of your app].  
	  </li>
	 <li><span class="yui-non"><b> Feedback [Test]:</b> Other students should provide feedback either by completing this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e7Rsk3KTjBAB9O1wSFm5Nh3QREnV15hdeMJ2BzLU4K8/copy" target="_blank" title="">feedback form</a> or by answering the following questions. Is the app presented socially useful why or why not? What is a strength of the proposed app? What suggestions do you have to improve the app?</span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Iteration 2: Minimal App</h3>
	<p>Working in pairs, create a minimal working app. Remember that for the Create 2 project, your project should use a List and if needed a database like TinyDB for handling data, as well as procedures with parameters that you have defined and sequence, selection, and iteration. Complete the following:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Minimal App [Prototype, Test]:</b> Work with your partner to begin building an initial prototype with minimal functionality. Take your paper prototype from Iteration #1 and determine what functionality should be created first during Iteration #2 and what can be added in later iterations. Use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7EuXo3d1gOKGBlyHNltLpd2tKLNkZ3rKlGiRRLiFdY/copy" target="_blank" title="">Mobile App Planning Document</a> to help you. In MIT App Inventor, begin designing the user interface based on your paper prototype and programming some initial functionality and features. For the final version of your app, you should be using a list and a procedure with a parameter. For this iteration, focus on building one or the other. Stop to test often (after approximately adding one or two features or functionalities).</span></li>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:</b> As you work, keep a journal of your development process and how you programmed each of the features. Complete a journal entry using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp2nLWOxFOkbjIzvzb_f_nYX32pgGXBh8qMjA0pzCZY/copy" target="_blank" title="">this template</a>.
	  </span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Iteration 3: Intermediate App </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Intermediate App [Prototype, Test]:</b>Continue to iteratively add and test new features for your app - add one or two features/functionality and then test. By the end of this iteration, you should have implemented at least 2 of the following: a list, procedure, or algorithm.</span></li>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:</b> As you work, keep a journal of your development process and how you programmed each of the features. Complete a journal entry using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp2nLWOxFOkbjIzvzb_f_nYX32pgGXBh8qMjA0pzCZY/copy" target="_blank" title="">this template</a>.
	  </span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Iteration 4: Advanced App </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Advanced App [Prototype, Test]:&nbsp;</b>Iteratively add and test new features for your app, meeting the grading guidelines. By the end of this iteration, you should have implemented at least 3 of the following: a list, a procedure with parameter, and an algorithm with sequence, selection, and iteration 
	</span></li>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:</b> As you work, keep a journal of your development process and how you programmed each of the features. Complete a journal entry using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp2nLWOxFOkbjIzvzb_f_nYX32pgGXBh8qMjA0pzCZY/copy" target="_blank" title="">this template</a>.
	  </span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Iteration 5: Additional Features </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Additional Features [Prototype, Test]:&nbsp;</b>Iteratively add and test new features for your app.
	</span></li>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:</b> As you work, keep a journal of your development process and how you programmed each of the features. Complete a journal entry using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp2nLWOxFOkbjIzvzb_f_nYX32pgGXBh8qMjA0pzCZY/copy" target="_blank" title="">this template</a>.</span></li></ul>
