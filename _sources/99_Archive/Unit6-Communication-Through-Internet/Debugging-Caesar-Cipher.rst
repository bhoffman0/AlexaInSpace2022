	<p><h3>Activity</h3>
    <p>The activity for this lesson is to <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="debugging">debug</span> a version of the Caesar cipher app. There are at least <b>five errors</b> in 
    this version of the app. See if you can find and correct them all! To get started, 
    <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?repo=templates.appinventor.mit.edu/trincoll/csp/unit5/templates/CaesarApp/CaesarCipherBuggy.asc" target="_blank">open App Inventor with the Caesar Cipher Buggy template</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>Here are some hints and suggestions.
      </p><ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">If you see a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='run-time error'>run-time error</span> message, read it carefully - it's trying to tell you where the bug is. A <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='run-time error'>run-time error</span> is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages, such as MIT App Inventor, define their own run-time errors.  For example, if the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='run-time error'>run-time error</span> complains about exceeding the length of the text, then the loop going through the text letter by letter did not stop at the end of the text.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The bugs can be in both the encryption and decryption steps.  So make sure you test the app thoroughly, with appropriate inputs. When you are testing this app, <b>only type in lowercase letters in the plaintext textbox to encrypt, and only type in uppercase letters in the Ciphertext textbox to decrypt</b>.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">You are may see more problems if you encrypt longer rather than shorter messages.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">If you are having trouble locating a problem, use a <i>Notifier</i> or use <i>Label1</i> to 
          display intermediate values of local or global variables.  
        </li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">You may also compare this code to your finished Caesar Cipher app from the previous lesson.</li>
    <li>Use App Inventor's Do It tool to evaluate expressions and intermediate values. Here's a short
          video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ceHVE_L_8" target="_blank">how to use Do It</a>.
        </li>

    :answer_b: compiler 
    :feedback_b: Mistakes are welcome here! Try reviewing this; the compiler runs the program statements whether or not they are formulated correctly. If there is a syntax error, the compiler will inform you that there is an error.
    :answer_c: programming language 
    :feedback_c: Mistakes are welcome here! Try reviewing this; the programming language is the language the statements are written in. The programming language itself does not determine if the statements are formulated correctly. The programming language's syntax does this.

    :answer_a: Rebuild the app and then retest the app 
    :feedback_a: Here are some strategies to figure this out. The programmer should not rebuild their entire app just because there is a bug in it. They should take their time to examine the code and form a hypothesis about what the bug may be. Then they should design and implement an experiment, and then debug and retest their app.
    :answer_b: Form a hypothesis about what might be wrong, design an experiment to test their hypothesis, perform the experiment, debug, and then retest the app.  
    :feedback_b: That's right! When debugging a program, a programmer should form a hypothesis about what the bug might be, then design and implement an experiment to test their hypothesis. If their hypothesis was correct, then the programmer should debug the app and retest. If their hypothesis was wrong, the programmer should form a new hypothesis
    :answer_c: Form a hypothesis and then retest the app. 
    :feedback_c: Here are some strategies to figure this out. He/she should form a hypothesis about what could possible be wrong with the code, however, just forming a hypothesis and then retesting the app is not enough.
    :answer_d: Immediately start changing code and retest the app. 
    :feedback_d: Here are some strategies to figure this out. It is not recommended that he/she start changing code without first thinking about, and forming an hypothesis, about what could possible be wrong. The programmer should take their time, form a hypothesis, design and implement an experiment, and then debug and retest theirapp.
