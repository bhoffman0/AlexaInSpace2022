Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html
	
	<p>Select and research a computing innovation of your own choosing. (Students should not use the citizen science app that they investigated earlier.) Computing innovations are innovations that includes a computer or program code as an integral part of their functionality. For example, self-driving cars are an example of an innovation that uses both hardware (the car, sensors, computer, etc.) as well as software (program code) to drive a car without a person steering the wheel or taking control of the car. However, near field communication (NFC), is not a computing innovation; rather, it is a standard that allows computing innovations to transfer data between them when they are close together.</p>


Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>To find a computing innovation, you could look at current news articles for inspiration. Mobile CSP maintains a list at <a href="http://diigo.com/user/mobilecsp" target="_blank">diigo.com/user/mobilecsp</a>, tagged by topics in the CS Principles course. You should find at least 5 credible sources on your innovation. (<a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/most-reliable-and-credible-sources-for-students" target="_blank">Examples of credible sources</a> and <a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/teaching-strategies/turn-students-into-fact-finding-web-detectives" target="_blank">fact-checking tips and tools</a>.) A reference list should be included with the project (e.g. at the end of a video, presentation, paper, part of a poster) and should follow standard formats such as MLA or APA specified by the instructor.</p>
	
	<p>Write a paper or create a presentation, poster, or other artifact that answers the following questions about the computing innovation.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>What is the purpose of your chosen computing innovation? Make sure you explain how it is a computing innovation as well.</li>
	  <li>What data does the innovation use and how does the innovation use the data collected?</li>
	  <li>What are the intended positive impacts of your citizen science app? What might be some unintended negative impacts? You might consider impacts on society, the economy, culture, etc.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h4>Artifact Formats</h4>
	<p>Note: your teacher may specify one of the following formats for your artifact about your innovation or may allow you to choose among the different options.</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Paper (~3 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman, Font Size 12)</li>
	  <li>Presentation (in-class or video recording, ~5 minutes)</li>
	  <li>Poster</li>
	  <li>Other artifact with instructor permission (audio recording, skit, brochure, etc.)</li>
	</ul>
