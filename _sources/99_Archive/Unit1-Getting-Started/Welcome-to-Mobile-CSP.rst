Welcome to Mobile CSP
=====================

    <p>Welcome!  <a href="http://mobile-csp.org" target="_blank">Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP)</a> is an Advanced Placement (AP) level introduction to computer science.  As its name suggests, the course teaches about the principles of computer science from the  perspective of mobile computing.  This Google Course Builder site is the free and open online version of the course. </p>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing">
    Mobile computing</a> is an emerging field that focuses on mobile devices, such as 
    tablets and smart phones.  In this course we will use the mobile programming language,
    <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">App Inventor</a>, to program 
    our Android tablets and smart phones.   You will learn how to design and 
    build  mobile apps – apps that are aware of their location, apps that send and receive text 
    messages, apps that give advice and directions.  The only limit on the types of apps
    you will learn to build is your own imagination.  So, in this course you will learn 
    <i>coding</i> or <i>computer programming</i>.</p>
    <p>But computer science is not just about coding.  So, we will also learn broadly 
    about the fundamental principles of computer science.  We'll learn about the potential
    and the limitations of computing and coding.  We'll learn how to manipulate large 
    data sets and about the importance of data in today's computing environment.  We'll
    learn how the Internet works and how encryption is used to protect our Internet 
    transactions.  We'll  learn about the positive and negative aspects of computing in 
    today's society.  And lots more.</p>
    <p>The Mobile CSP course consists of seven main units with the big ideas of the College Board's curricular framework known as <a href="http://apcsprinciples.org/" target="_blank">Computer Science Principles (CSP)</a> spiraled across the units. The CSP framework consists of <b>five Big Ideas</b>: Creative Development (CRD), Data (DAT), Algorithms and Programming (AAP), Computing Systems and Networks (CSN), and Impact of Computing (IOC). In addition, the <b>six Computational Thinking Practices</b>: Computational Solution Design, Algorithms and Program Development, Abstraction in Program Development, Code Analysis, Computing Innovations, and Responsible Computing and their associated skills of the CSP framework are both developmentally sequenced and spiraled across the units, building on each other. The CSP framework was developed by leading computer science educators from around the country with guidance from the College Board and with funding support
    from the National Science Foundation. The first AP CSP exam was offered in spring 2017.</p>
