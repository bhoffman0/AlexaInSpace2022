Alexa in Space
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. raw:: html

	<p>Mobile CSP has partnered with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/">Amazon Future Engineer (AFE)</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/space">Alexa for Astronauts program</a>. As part of this partnership we have created this <b>Alexa in Space</b> unit focused on programming Amazon Alexa skills in MIT App Inventor with a space-theme. In this unit, you will explore artificial intelligence (AI) concepts by creating Alexa skills. In addition, you will explore the question of how voice AI can help inexperienced space travelers, such as tourists, complete everyday tasks in a microgravity environment.

	<p><b>NEW:</b> Teachers and students are invited to participate in a space tour as well as a new space-themed Amazon Alexa skill challenge that will launch in Fall 2022.
