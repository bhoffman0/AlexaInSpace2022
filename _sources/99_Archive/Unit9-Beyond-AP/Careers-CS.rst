	<p>Here's an idea: organize a <b>field trip</b> to a local company or have local IT professionals visit your classroom! These do not have to be tech companies, either. Many businesses, governments,  organizations, and even schools rely on Information Technology (IT) departments, including hospitals and clinics, power companies, city government, etc. Not sure where to start? Reach out to your local Chamber of Commerce or your local college or university and ask them.</p>
