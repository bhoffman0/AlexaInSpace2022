.. raw:: html

	<p>This unit provides some ideas for what to do after the AP CSP exam.&nbsp; The next lessons provide some ideas exploring careers in CS, films in CS, transitioning to text programming and CS A, and many optional App Inventor tutorials to may be used after the AP CSP exam. Teachers can choose which tutorials they would like their students to do. &nbsp;There are also tutorials available online at&nbsp;<a>http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html.</a>&nbsp; <br><br>Another option is to have students design and build their own apps or continue their create projects. Students may want to submit their apps to the <a>App Inventor App of the Month Gallery</a>&nbsp;or the <a href="http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/" target="_blank" title="">Congressional App Challenge</a>. Another idea is to have your own expo day where students present their Create projects to the school!</p>
