	<p><h3>Chapter Three: Ghosts in the Machine: Secrets and Surprises of Electronic Documents</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter3.pdf">
    Chapter Three of Blown to Bits</a> describes how <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='digital'>digital</span> documents, 
    including images and sounds, are represented by sequences of bits. Why do you think this chapter is called "Ghosts in the Machine"?</p>
    <p>As you learned in the previous lesson and as shown in the this diagram, the first step in representing an image is to convert it into a sequence of bits.  This is known as <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='modeling'>modeling</span>. The model is an <i><b>abstract representation</b></i> of the original image.</p>
    <div class="yui-wk-div" style="text-align: center"><img class="yui-img selected" src="../_static/assets/img/FaceModel.png"/></div>
    <p><b>Activity: </b>Read Chapter Three (up to page 99) to discover what's hidden in electronic documents.</p>
    <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Part 1: What You See Is Not What the Computer Knows - Read pg. 73 and 74 out loud as a class and discuss the word "redacted." Continue reading this section (up to pg. 80), using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yBzUmMimZ7YVF0x9osqcGRtHP-RkT46MLAjL2mzsAe0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Conversation Questions Template</a> to write down a question about 3-4 ideas that were important, surprising, or thought provoking. In small groups, discuss your questions. <p><b><i>Metadata</i></b> (data about data) is described and discussed on pg. 78-80. Here are a few additional things you should know about metadata:</p><ul><li>Metadata are used for finding, organizing, and managing information. </li> <li>Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information.</li><li> Metadata allow data to be structured and organized.<br/></li></ul>
    </li>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Part 2: Representation, Reality, and Illusion - Read pg. 80-94 and complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvLYKuRZ66FMd_BSkDVBj8rrg6YN5QbHBx8CxcPnq_Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Now That's Surprising Template</a>. In small groups, discuss your notes.</li>
    <li>Part 3: Hiding Information in Images (pg. 95-99) is called <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='steganography'>steganography</span>. First, answer the question below, then read the chapter pages as needed to help you complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rMlcppxtV-v9Ti7RDe6L6dlCczXXu8oQjZz8f9KLFaE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this activity</a>—you'll have an opportunity to hide your initials, or some 3-letter word, in an image. Try it, it's fun!</li>

    <p>
    <p>Printers sometimes add secret dots to documents when they're printed, very similar to <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='steganography'>steganography</span>. In fact, the secret dots on a leaked, classified document were able to help the FBI identify a potential suspect. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170607-why-printers-add-secret-tracking-dots" target="_blank">Read more in this article from the BBC.</a></p>

        &lt;b&gt;Short answer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is metadata? Give an example of how a piece of metadata could increase the usefulness of an image or document.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is a model? &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What&#39;s the difference between a raster image and an ASCII representation of a text document?&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;What is free and open source software? Provide an example.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Free Response:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How has retouching become a controversial issue? Give an example.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Would you rather own a camera (or camera phone) with a higher number of megapixels or lower? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Other than digital images, what might be an example of a computer model? Explain your answer based on the definition of a model.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The code that implements App Inventor is open source and its impact on education is obvious.  Find another example of open source software and describe its positive impact on education, business or society.&lt;/li&gt;
