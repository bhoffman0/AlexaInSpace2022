ASSESSMENT: AP Create 1
========================

.. raw:: html

     <h3 id="est-length">Time Estimate: 6 hours (8 45 minute classes) minimum</h3><p>Follow these directions if you are taking CSP as an AP course. If you are in a non-AP CSP course, please go to the next lesson for Non-AP Create directions.
     
Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>In this Create Project #1, you will work with a partner to design a socially useful interactive app, that  demonstrates algorithms such as selection and procedural abstractions. As you develop your project keep track of significant errors and bugs that you encountered and how you solved or debugged them in a journal.</p>

     <p>Before beginning, please review the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles#page=4" target="_blank">Create Performance Task Description and Instructions</a></li><li><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap21-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles" target="_blank" title="">Create Performance Task Scoring Guidelines</a></li></ul><ul>
     </ul>
     <p>
           In the official Create: Programming Performance Task #2 you will need to address <b>ALL</b> of the requirements and prompts as outlined in the performance task directions (i.e. a list, procedure with parameter, and algorithm with sequence, selection, and iteration). However, this is a <b>PRACTICE</b> programming performance task therefore not all aspects are required to be completed. You are not expected to include a procedure with a parameter for this practice task, but you should at least include a procedure. It is recommended that you try to include a loop.</p>

	<h3>Iterative Design Thinking Process</h3>
     <p>Use an Iterative Design Thinking Process to develop your app:<br>

Learning Activities 
----------------------------------

.. raw:: html
	
	<h3>Warm Up Activity: Design a Chair</h3>

     <p>Your teacher may have you do the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Y9RPf6IhZ4pZRjtosXdergQPCLRgrmY_TTMr4N9xpU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Design Thinking Process: Design a Chair Activity</a> in pairs or groups to practice the Design Thinking Process.


	<h3>Create #1 Directions</h3>

     <p>Working in pairs, follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbHDdR-l5JF9xGor-hChrqB8pzCnxgxwMY-vBCZqJYI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="">Design Thinking iterative development process for the
               Create Performance Tasks</a>.

        <h3>Iteration 1: Paper Prototype</h3>
     <p>Before you start creating the app in App Inventor, you will brainstorm ideas on paper with a partner and present an elevator pitch to your class. Turn in the following:
     <ul>
       <li><b>Description of Problem [Empathize, Define, and Ideate]:</b> Working in pairs,  think about problems in your community and how an app might help to solve those problems or to help people in your community. Who is the target audience or users who will be using the app? What problem does the app address? How does the app address the problem?
       </li>
       <li><b>Paper Prototypes [Prototype]: </b> Create <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1M-DZITeDT9aiPZ7Oz-kXKEGkn0DiFOH1i8idBNlxwCA/edit" target="_blank">paper prototypes</a> of three different brainstorm ideas. Describe what each UI element will do.</li>

       <li><b>Elevator Pitch:</b> Present a short (2-3 minute) elevator pitch of your project idea to the class.  The pitch could follow this template: <br>
           <b><i>[name of app] is a [kind of thing] for [the people who would use it or problem it would solve] that, unlike [similar apps] is able to [the major distinguishing feature of your app].</i></b></li>
       <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Feedback [Test]: </b>Other students should provide feedback by completing this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e7Rsk3KTjBAB9O1wSFm5Nh3QREnV15hdeMJ2BzLU4K8/edit" target="_blank" title="">feedback form</a> or by answering the following questions. Is the app presented socially useful why or why not? What is a strength of the proposed app? What suggestions do you have to improve the app? </span></li>
     </ul>


     <h3>Iteration 2: Minimal Working App</h3>
     <p>Working in pairs, create a minimal working app. Turn in the following:
     <ul>
       <li><b>Minimal App [Prototype and Test]</b>: Build an initial prototype with minimal functions for your app with your partner. </li>
      <li><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:&nbsp;</b>As you work, keep a journal of your development process and problems encountered and how you solved them. Complete a journal entry using this&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp2nLWOxFOkbjIzvzb_f_nYX32pgGXBh8qMjA0pzCZY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="">journal entry template</a>.</li></ul><h3>Iteration 3 and On: </h3>
     <ul>

       <li><b>Enhanced App [Prototype and Test]</b>: Iteratively add and test new features for your app, meeting the grading guidelines.  For the Create 1 project, your project should have at least 1 variable, 1 procedure that you have defined, and use an if/else block. <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Documentation of Code:</b> For this assignment, a well documented app means having well named components, variables, and procedures. </li>
            <li><b>Data:</b> For this assignment, your app should make appropriate use of variables and lists.</li>
            <li><b>Algorithms:</b> For this assignment, your app should include math and/or logic operations (math and if/ese blocks) and procedures.</li>
            <li><b>Abstraction:</b> For this assignment, your app should include a programmer defined procedure.</li>

          </ol> </li>
      <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:</b> Keep a journal of your development process and problems encountered and how you solved them. Complete a journal entry using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp2nLWOxFOkbjIzvzb_f_nYX32pgGXBh8qMjA0pzCZY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="">journal entry template</a>.</span></li></ul><ul>
