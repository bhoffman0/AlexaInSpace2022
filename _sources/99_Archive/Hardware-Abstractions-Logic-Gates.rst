Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>In this lesson we will look at some additional examples of how  the Big Idea of
      <i>abstraction</i> is used in computing. We will focus on low-level hardware abstractions,
      in particular, on <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='logic gate'>logic gates</span>, the fundamental computational building blocks of 
      electronic circuits.  We'll tak a first look "under the hood," so to speak, to see how computers 
      process binary information.

    <h3>Logicly Activity</h3>
    <p><a href="http://logic.ly/demo" target="_blank">Logicly</a> provides an 
      engaging, hands-on learning environment for teaching logic gates and circuits.  It
      provides some free online-demos of simple logic gates.  To help solidify your
      <img align="right" src="../_static/assets/img/LogiclyLiveExample.png" width="200"/>
      understanding of the basic gates, click on the links below. 
      In each case, review the truth table definitions and then play with the <i>Live Example</i>
      circuit to verify that it behaves as defined by the truth table.
      <br/>
      NOTE: To create your own circuits you need go into Edit mode by clicking on the 
      little widget on the bottom left of the Live Example frame, as shown in the picture.
      Then you can drag together components and put them together. If you do not see the Live Example, first click on the   Adobe Flash Player link and then click on allow Run Flash.

    <h3>Designing a Computational Circuit:  Critical Thinking Exercises</h3>
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The word <b>OR</b> has different meaning in the following two sentences; which meaning corresponds to the Boolean <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='OR gate'>OR gate</span>?
          <ul>
    <li>Choose either soup <b>OR</b> salad with your entree.</li>
    <li>Insurance benefits will be paid in case of accident <b>OR</b> illness.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Define 2 truth tables, one for each of the two meanings of OR that you discussed above.  Your truth table should
          consist of 4 rows that together provide all possible values for inputs A and B and what the result Z would be. For example, A is "soup" and B is "salad" and Z is "soup or salad" for one of the meanings of or above. 
          
	<table style="width:200px; border: 1px solid black; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <tbody>
	<tr><th style="border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;width:75px;">A</th><th style="border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;width:75px;">B</th><th style="border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;width:75px;">Z</th></tr>
	<tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td> </td></tr>
    <tr><td>True</td><td>False</td><td> </td></tr>
    <tr><td>True</td><td>True</td><td> </td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
	<br/>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">(<b>Portfolio</b>) The first sense of <b>OR</b> (soup or salad) is known as <b>Exclusive OR</b> and
          the second sense (accident or illness) is known as <b>Inclusive-OR</b>.  Inclusive-OR
          is the same as Boolean OR.  Exclusive-OR can
          be defined as:
          <br/>
    <center style="font-size:large">(Either A <font color="red">OR</font> B) <font color="red">AND</font>  (<font color="red">NOT</font> 
            (both A <font color="red"> AND </font> B)).</center>
    <br/> Use  <a href="http://logic.ly/demo" target="_blank">Logicly edit mode</a> to construct the Exclusive-OR
          circuit. As suggested in the definition, you'll need to combine AND, OR, and NOT gates.  The
          circuit should have 2 inputs and 1 output.  Make sure your circuit behaves as defined by the
          truth table you created in part #2. (Hint:  For this circuit you'll need 2 AND gates, 1 <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='OR gate'>OR gate</span>,
          and 1 <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='NOT gate'>NOT gate</span>.  Also, you should use switches, not buttons, for the 2 inputs.)
        </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">(<b>Portfolio</b>) Consider these three things: The <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='OR gate'>OR gate</span> (i.e., the physical circuit), 
        the <i>Boolean OR function</i> (as defined by its truth table), and the <i>OR symbol</i>.  How
        would arrange them from <b>most abstract to least abstract</b>?  And what criterion would you
        use to determine their order?</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Pictured here is a
          Logicly version of the flip-flop discussed in the lecture.  A flip-flop is a basic 
          memory circuit that stores a single bit -- either a 0 or 1.  Implement this circuit in
           <a href="http://logic.ly/demo" target="_blank">Logicly edit mode</a>. NOTE that NOR gates (not <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='OR` gate'>OR gates</span>) are being used in this circuit and that
          the inputs are Push Buttons (not switches). The light should turn on when you click the bottom button
          and turn off when you click the top button.  Which <b><i>memory state</i></b> (a 0 or a 1) is represented 
          by clicking the bottom button as seen in the image below?

    </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>AP CSP Pseudocode Logical Operators</h3>
    
    In MIT App Inventor and in the AP CSP pseudocode, the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT can be used to combine boolean expressions in programming, and they behave in the same way that the AND, OR, and NOT logic gates behave in computer hardware. The exam reference sheet provides the definitions for the following logical operators where the condition can be a single boolean value or a boolean expression made up of other values and operators.
    <ul>
    <li> <b> NOT condition</b>: evaluates to true if condition is false; otherwise it evaluates to false.</li>
    <li> <b>condition1 AND condition2</b>:  evaluates to true if both condition1 and condition2 are true; otherwise it evaluates to false. </li>
    <li><b> condition1 OR condition2</b>:  evaluates to true if condition1 is true or if condition2 is true or if both condition1 and condition2 are true; otherwise it evaluates to false.
    </li></ul>

    <!--  &lt;p&gt;In your portfolio, create a new page named &lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Hardware Abstractions&lt;/i&gt; in your portfolio and&amp;nbsp;provide thoughtful answers to  the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) Include a screenshot of your Logicly diagram for the Exclusive-OR circuit.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) Consider these three things: The &lt;i&gt;OR gate&lt;/i&gt; (i.e., the physical circuit),     the &lt;i&gt;Boolean OR function&lt;/i&gt; (as defined by its truth table), and the &lt;i&gt;OR symbol&lt;/i&gt;.  How would arrange them from &lt;b&gt;most abstract to least abstract&lt;/b&gt;?  And what criterion would you use to determine their order?    &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Consider these three things:  A binary digit (e.g., 1 or 0),  the flip-flop circuit diagram (&lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/LogiclyFlipFlop.png&quot; width=&quot;50&quot; align=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;), and the flip-flop circuit (i.e., the physical circuit).  How would you arrange them from &lt;b&gt;most abstract to least abstract&lt;/b&gt; and what criterion would you use to determine their order?  &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;-->
