Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>We've been using algorithms to build our apps and we've learned about algorithms for solving certain types of problems, such as searching and sorting problems.</p>
    <p>It may seem that no matter what the problem, we can find an algorithm to solve it.  But that is not true.  And in this lesson we want to look at some problems that algorithms cannot solve or cannot solve efficiently.</p>
	<div><b>Learning Objectives:</b>&nbspI will learn to</div>
	<ul>
	<li>differentiate between problems that have <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="reasonable time">reasonable</span> solutions and those that do not </li>
	<li>discuss <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="heuristic algorithm">heuristic</span> solutions when an optimal solution is not possible</li>
	<li>explain how <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="intractable problems">intractability</span> can be used to solve problems such as password security</li>
	</ul>
	<div><b>Language Objectives:</b>&nbspI will be able to</div>

	<p> There are two categories of problems that an algorithm cannot solve.
	</p>
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='undecidable problems'>Undecidable Problems</span>.  These problems
          are the theoretically impossible to solve — by any algorithm.

        </li>
    <li><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='intractable problems'>Intractable Problems</span>.  These problems are
          theoretically impossible to solve in a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='reasonable time'>reasonable time</span> — i.e., there are known algorithmic
          solutions, but the algorithms are too inefficient/slow to solve the 
          problem when the number of inputs grows large.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The following video will give us an overview of these types of limits to algorithms and will illustrate how we can use the fact that certain problems are <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='intractable problems'>intractable</span> to protect our passwords and other information.

    <h3>POGIL Activity for the Classroom: Creating a Strong Password (15 minutes)</h3>
    <p>To give us a better sense of what it takes to create a strong password -- i.e., one that can
        withstand a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='brute force'>brute force</span> attack --  we're going to use the Password Strength Calculator
        to test the strength of various password schemes. (<a href="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/passwords/index.html" target="_blank" title="">Open widget in a separate window</a>)
        <iframe height="700" src="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/passwords/index.html" style="border: 0;" title="Password Strength Calculator" width="100%"></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, an ordinary desktop computer 
        equipped with special password cracking software can test more
        than 100 million passwords per second.  
        The goal of this activity is to come up with the <b><i>optimal password scheme</i></b> that would take
        an ordinary PC, equipped with password-cracking software, more than 10 years to crack. 
      </p>

    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">(<b>Portfolio</b>) A <b><i>password scheme</i></b> consists of a minimum password length and 
          the different types of symbols  (i.e., letters, numbers, specials) that can be used in the password.
          Using the Password Strength Calculator, determine the <b><i>optimal scheme</i></b> for withstanding a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='brute force'>brute force</span>
          attack of at least 10 years by an ordinary PC performing 100 million tests per second. 
        </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">(<b>Portfolio</b>) According to <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/316266-the-nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-can-probably-crack-your-passwords" target="_blank">this 
          2020 article</a>, a password-cracking computer can try 669 billion passwords per second. How would you have to modify your scheme to withstand a 10-year attack by this specially designed computer?
        </li>
    <li>(<b>Portfolio</b>) After you’ve calculated the estimated number of passwords that can be checked per second for the next year, use the Password Strength Calculator to determine an optimal password scheme.

    <h3>Heuristic Solutions to Intractable Problems</h3>
    <p>For some <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='intractable problems'>intractable problems</span>, we need to have practical 
      solutions.  One such example is the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='The Traveling Salesman Problem'>Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</span>:
      Construct the most efficient route, <b>the optimal route</b>, that visits <i>N</i> cities. This is an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='optimization problem'>optimization problem</span> where the goal is to find the "best" (most optimal) solution among many.
    </p>
    <p>This is a problem we would like to be able to solve.  Variations
      of this problem are the kinds of problems that Google maps and other apps solve for us
      when we ask for driving directions.
    </p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are so-called heuristic algorithms that computer
      scientists use to solve such problems. A <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='heuristic algorithm'>heuristic algorithm</span> is one
      that provides a solution to a problem, although in many cases the solution may not be
      the best possible solution -- i.e., it may not be an optimal solution.

    <h3>POGIL Activity for the Classroom: Traveling Salesman Problem (15 minutes)</h3>
    <p>Using the same POGIL teams as above, let's give the <i><b>nearest neighbor heuristic</b></i>  a try on this problem.
        </p><blockquote>
        A Trinity College student needs to visit some of the <a href="http://mobile-csp.org/?q=partners" target="_blank">Mobile CSP Schools</a>
        in Hartford, Connecticut.  The following map shows the schools that need to be visited and gives the

        that will visit all of the schools.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Starting and ending at Trinity College, find the optimal route that visits all schools. (HINT: To prove that

        </li>
    <li>(<b>Portfolio</b>) For routes starting and ending at Trinity College, you have identified the nearest neighbor route and

    :answer_b: Intractable
    :feedback_b: Yes. If the string has <i>N</i> letters 'a' to 'z', then there are 26<sup>N</sup> possible strings, which is <i>exponential</i>.  This is similar to trying to crack a long password made up of lowercase letters. In this case, each letter in the password can be one of 26 possible letters.   If you made such a password long enough (e.g., more than 15 letters), it would be fairly secure from brute force attack.

      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) A &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;password scheme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; consists of a minimum password length and 
          the different types of symbols  (i.e., letters, numbers, specials) that can be used in the password.
          Using the Password Strength Calculator, determine the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;optimal scheme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for withstanding a brute force
          attack of at least 10 years by an ordinary PC performing 100 million tests per second. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-cracks-every-standard-windows-password-in-6-hours/&quot;&gt;this 
          2012 article&lt;/a&gt;, a password-cracking computer can try 350 billion passwords per second.  How would you have
          to modify your scheme to withstand a 10-year attack by this specially designed computer? 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) That article was written in 2012, almost 5 years ago. Password cracking technology has
          probably gotten a lot better.  Suppose the number of passwords that can be checked per second doubles every 
          year,  use the Password Strength Calculator to determine an optimal password scheme for the year 2020?
        &lt;/li&gt;
