	<p>As the video above describes, when you do a Google search, you aren't actually
			searching the Web, you're searching Google's <i>index</i> of the Web.  Google's
			<i>spider programs</i> are constantly traversing the web, collecting millions of 
			web pages and organizing them into an index.  When you do a Web search
			Google's algorithms are searching that index.
			</p>
			<p>What's the best algorithm for searching an index?  An index is an <i>ordered</i> 
			collection.  Think of the index that comes  at the back of a textbook.  It is organized 
			in alphabetical order. Each entry in the index refers to some page in the book. 
			</p>
    <div class="pogil yui-wk-div">
    <h3>POGIL Activity for the Classroom (15 minutes)</h3>
    <p>To help you think about the <b>problem of searching an index</b> we're going to play 
        a guessing game.  The objective of the game is to come up with the <b>most efficient</b>
        algorithm for guessing a number between 1 and 100, where <i>most efficient</i> means
        that it takes the fewest number of guesses. 
      </p>
    <p>To play the game you can use the widget below (<a href="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/binarygame.html" target="_blank">or open in a new window</a>):
        </p><center><iframe align="center" height="360" instanceid="huHMgRJGuaCr" src="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/binarygame.html" title="Binary search 2" width="550">
    </iframe>
    </center>
    <p></p>
    <p>Or, you can play the game without a computer, in which case one team member will
        think of a secret number between 1 and 100 and the other team members will 
        collaborate to try to come up with the best guess. Just as in the widget,
        after each guess, the person who knows the secret will tell the guessers
        whether the guess was too high or too low or just right.
      </p>
    <p>After figuring out a good algorithm, write it in <b>pseudocode</b>.
      </p>
    <p>Break into POGIL teams of 4.  Record your answers <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQCHw9qhIq5M7a57xjMn-daD7BdVv7h3fjA4J8Vn160/edit" target="_blank">using this worksheet</a>. (File-Make a Copy to have a version you can edit.)

    <h3>Guessing Game:  I'll Guess Your Secret Number</h3>
    <p> One way to look at this game is that we are searching for a number 
      in a list of numbers.  Our search made use of the fact that numbers are ordered. 
      The feedback we received – "too high" or "too low" –  was based on that order. 
      If you're still working on figuring out an efficient algorithm, maybe the following widget
      will give you some ideas.  Try to observe the algorithm that the widget  is using. (<a href="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/binary.html" target="_blank">Open widget in new window.</a>)
      </p><center>
    <iframe height="360" src="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/binary.html" style="border: 0;" title="Binary Search" width="550"></iframe>
    </center>
    <p></p>
    <h3>An Efficient Algorithm</h3>
    <p>There is an efficient algorithm for the guessing game problem, known as the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="binary search">binary search </span> algorithm. It is called in because you repeatedly diaryvide the search space into two and eliminate one half of the search space. 
      Click <a href="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/binarysearch.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see 
      the pseudocode or see the algorithm comparison section below.
    </p>
    <h3>Linear (or Sequential) Search</h3>
    <p>What if you had to search a set of data that was <b>not sorted</b>?  <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="binary search">Binary search </span> won't work in that case.  To illustrate this problem, let's try a variation of our
    guessing game.  This time the app will only tell you if your guess is right or wrong, not
    whether it is too high or too low.  Try it. (<a href="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/sequential.html" target="_blank">Open widget in new window.</a>)
    
    </p><center>
    <iframe align="center" height="400" instanceid="tMyBr7m7BCqa" src="https://mobile-csp.org/webapps/search/sequential.html" title="Sequential guessing" width="550">
    </iframe>
    <br/>
    </center>
    <p>As you can see from this game, if you don't know the order of the items you are
    going to search, you have no choice but to search them <i><b>sequentially</b></i>
    if you definitely want to find the secret number. 
    
    </p>
    <h3>Comparing Linear vs. Binary Search Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Here is a comparison of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="linear or sequential search">sequential search</span> and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="binary search">binary search</span> looking for a target in a list of N items in AP style pseudocode. Don't worry about understanding the details about the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="binary search">binary search</span> algorithm, but do understand the general way it works. <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="binary search">Binary search</span> is more complex but it is much faster. However, the list must be in a sorted order for a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="binary search">binary search</span> to work. <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="linear or sequential search">Linear search</span> is slower but works with any list in any order.

    {
       IF (target &lt; middle) 
           high ← middle - 1    (This cuts off the top half of the list)
       IF (target &gt; middle)
           low ← middle + 1     (This cuts off the bottom half of the list)
       middle ← item (low+high)/2  (compute new middle)    
    }
    IF (middle = target)
        DISPLAY "Found target!"

    <!-- Replaced with AP pseudocode 
    &lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a summary of the sequential (or linear) search algorithm.  Let&#39;s suppose we have 16 boxes
    numbers 1 to 16, each containing a letter, but that the words are not in any particular
    order:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Problem: Find the letter &#39;F&#39;&lt;/b&gt;  
    &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;U&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Z&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;M&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;L&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Pseudocode of Sequential (or Linear) Search Algorithm&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;Let &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; represent the box number to search, initially 1
    Repeat until you find &#39;F&#39; or run out of boxes to search
        Look in box &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.
        If &#39;F&#39; is in box &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;, stop and report &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s value.
        Otherwise, add 1 to &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;
    If you don&#39;t find &#39;F&#39; in any box, report it not found.
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;So in this algorithm we are letting &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; keep track of what box we are searching. It
    starts at 1 and increases by 1 so that we will look at every box until we find
    &#39;F&#39; or run out of boxes.  If we find &#39;F&#39; we report what box it was in by reporting &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s
    value.  If we don&#39;t find it, we report  that it wasn&#39;t found.
    
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for &#39;F&#39; in this set of boxes represents our 
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;worst case scenario&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    because our algorithm would have to look in every box to conclude that &#39;F&#39; was not in the
    boxes. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

    :answer_a: Arranging a deck of cards from the lowest to the highest value cards. 
    :feedback_a: When you arrange a collection you are <i>sorting</i>. Therefore, a search algorithm cannot be used to solve this problem.
    :answer_b: Looking up a phone number in the phone book given the person's full (unique) name.
    :feedback_b: True. A linear search can be used to look up someone's phone number in the phone book. However, a sequential search would not be the most efficient search algorithm to use. Since the phone book is arranged in order by last name, you could solve this problem more efficiently using a binary search.
    :answer_c: Looking up a word in a Webster's dictionary. 
    :feedback_c: True. A linear search can be used to look up a word in the dictionary. However, a linear search would not be the most efficient search algorithm to use. Since a dictionary is in alphabetical order, you could solve this problem more efficiently using a binary search.
    :answer_d: Looking up a person's name in the phone book given the person's phone number. 
    :feedback_d: True. A phone book is arranged in order by last name, not by phone number. Therefore, you would need to start at one end of the phone book and check each phone number individually, in order, until you find the phone number you were given and then you can find the last name associated with the phone number.
    :answer_e: Guessing a secret number between 1 and 100. 
    :feedback_e: True. A linear search can be used to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. However, a linear search would not be the most efficient search algorithm to use. Since the numbers 1 to 100 are ordered numerically, you could solve this problem more efficiently using a binary search.
