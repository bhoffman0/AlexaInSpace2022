	<p><h3>Careful, your data is being collected!</h3>
    <p>Computing innovations, such as smartphones, collect information and data from their users and then use that data to accomplish tasks. In some cases those tasks may be obvious and part of the intended purpose of the innovation. In other cases, those tasks might be less obvious or even hidden from us. Watch the video below which explains that our <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Personally Identifiable Information (PII)">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</span> to be recorded and used. <br/>

    <h3>Explore Curricular Activity: How Computing Innovations Use and Analyze Data</h3>
    <h3>Activity - Part 1: Data Types and Data Collection</h3>
    <p>First, we need to understand the various types of data and how it is collected from us. Some examples of data types are integers, numbers, booleans, text, image, video, audio, and signals. Data can also infer these types, such as fingerprints, temperature, music, length, pictures, etc. Data is gathered by data collection devices (e.g., keyboards, sensors, cameras, etc.). Complete this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPVGCNXv_eHcahlfEBDqnlczAPCLGZBkpdlEkSte544/copy" target="_blank" title="">Data Types and Data Collection Reference Sheet</a> with some examples of your own and/or with your class. When you’re done, this document can be used as a reference sheet for the remainder of this lesson. </p>
    <h3>Activity - Part 2: Classifying Data</h3>
    <p>Earlier in the course you learned about what a computing innovation is and discussed some examples. You also learned about input and output. Now that you know what a computing innovation is and the kinds of data that can be collected, you can determine what data is collected by specific computing innovations. Using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqRKMRqCMU7OkIpZySR5ISYbNrzJNxRuF59Iu96sNSY/copy" target="_blank" title="">Classifying Data worksheet</a>, identify the data used by the listed computing innovations and then classify the data as input or output. When you are finished, compare your answers with a classmate.</p>
    <p><b>How is your data being used and are you concerned?</b> Disparate personal data, such as geolocation, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Cookies'>cookies</span>, and browsing history, can be aggregated to create knowledge about an individual. PII and other information stored online can be used to enhance a user’s online experiences and to simplify making online purchases. You may have seen targeted ads when browsing the web. Targeted ads are ads specific to you based on your browsing and purchase history. They are being used by stores (as shown in the NY times video below) and by websites for internet advertising.</p>
    
    <p><b>Discussion:</b> Watch the video to the below on Retailer's Predictions from the New York Times. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" title="">Here is the full article</a> if you're interested in reading more.). Then, take a look at a <a href="https://www.thebillfold.com/2016/03/show-us-your-grocery-receipts-part-seven-target/" target="_blank" title="">receipt from Target</a> and the data available on it. Consider the following questions to help you understand how companies like Target collect information on buying habits:<br/></p>
    <ul>
    <li>What data is included on the receipt?</li>
    <li>How might this data reveal demographics, personal life details, and other information about the consumer?</li>
    <li>Is it different if you pay for purchases with cash vs a credit or debit card? </li>
    <li>Is it different if you purchase items in the brick-and-mortar store or the online store? </li>
    </ul><br/>

    <p><img alt="" class="yui-img" src="../_static/assets/img/IPOS.png" title=""/></p>
    <br />
    <b>Input Process Output Storage:</b> Computing innovations involve data which can be used in different ways. Some data is considered <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">input</span> while other data is considered <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">output</span>. An Input Processing Output Storage (IPOS) Structure Chart helps to classify data and see how that data is being used as input, then <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">processed</span> by a program to give an output to the user, and also how that data is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">stored</span>. </p>
    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Can you draw, label, and explain the scenario of having to type a paper for a class using an IPOS structure chart?</p>
    
    <br />
    <h4>Data Concerns</h4>
    <p>The collection of our data raises a variety of concerns involving <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Data Privacy'>data privacy</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Data Security'>data security</span>, and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Data Storage'>data storage</span>. For example, commercial and governmental curation of information may be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored. Having a website collect and remember your login information, for example, may be convenient because it saves you time, but it also comes with risks and concerns:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Data Privacy'>Data Privacy</span> - assures that personal information (and sometimes corporate confidential information as well) are collected, processed (used), protected and destroyed legally and fairly.  </li>
    <li><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Data Security'>Data Security</span></span> - controls access to personal information and protects against its unauthorized use and acquisition. </li>
    <li><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Data Storage'>Data Storage</span> - how you archive your data. The two types of storage are hard data (RAM, Hard Drive, flash drives, solid state) and remote data (cloud computing) - <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23342/data-storage" target="_blank" title="">Techopedia</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Activity - Part 3: Collecting Data</h3>
    <p>The About My Info website (<a href="https://aboutmyinfo.org/" target="_blank" title="">aboutmyinfo.org</a>) asks for personal data to determine how easily identifiable someone is from their data. Data such as this is often used by doctors and schools. Explore the About My Info website and then explore the privacy policy for your favorite social media site. As you explore, record your findings and answer the questions on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hshcntNmNYY13DoWIX4bVZSiap7EM2XVeGjjysEcmUI/copy" target="_blank" title="">Collecting Data worksheet</a>.</p>
    <h3><br/>Activity - Part 4: Explore a Computing Innovation</h3>
    <p>Select a computing innovation and answer the following questions <i>independently</i> about your selected innovation:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Identify the data used by the computing innovation.</li>
    <li>Write a paragraph that explains how the data is consumed, transformed, or produced by this computing innovation.</li>
    <li>Write a paragraph that explains any <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='data privacy'>data privacy</span>, security, or storage concerns related to the computing innovation.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Read Blown to Bits Chapter 2</h3>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_4439HxJDBXbViBECySAQdRITEnSOPzs" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="yui-img" src="../_static/assets/img/blowntobits.jpg" style="float:left;padding-right:1em" title="" width="150"/></a>
    <p>Blown to Bits Chapter 2 focuses on the issue of how the digital explosion affects our privacy. This is an especially important issue for today's mobile computing generation. As we’ve seen, our smartphones and tablets can not only track our electronic correspondence, they can track our whereabouts, opening whole new areas of potential privacy infringements.</p>
    <p>What's especially interesting about the privacy question is that, for the most part, many seem to be willing to trade privacy for convenience. We don't mind letting the supermarket track our purchases if that brings us discounts. And we don't seem to mind letting mobile apps know and record our whereabouts in exchange for some service we like like GPS directions or even games.
    </p>
    <p>Read <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_4439HxJDBXbViBECySAQdRITEnSOPzs" target="_blank" title="">Chapter 2 of the updated Blown to Bits</a> to learn about some of the ways our electronic devices impinge on our privacy — some of the stories will surely surprise you. As you read the chapter, complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IiOfh052ziFDnYKTHA8gXjJvqHBfahLM5M0yQyM9lu8/copy" target="_blank" title="">double entry journal sheet</a>. Once you've completed the chapter, discuss your journal entries with your class. You might want to read through the portfolio homework questions below for some key ideas to focus on.</p>

        &lt;li&gt;Are you willing to trade some of your privacy for the convenience of having a computer or a company recommend products to you? Why or why not? Under what circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How do we leave digital &quot;footprints and fingerprints?&quot; Do you think this is important for everyone to know? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How have social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. affected our privacy?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In this course, you are building apps that collect data from users, the device, and its sensors. What responsibilities do we have as app developers for the data we collect?&lt;/li&gt;
