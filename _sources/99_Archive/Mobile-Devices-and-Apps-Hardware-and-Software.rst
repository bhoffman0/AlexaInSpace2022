    <p><h3>What is a Computer?</h3>
    <p>A computing device is an electronic device for storing and processing <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='data'>data</span> by following instructions given to it in a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='program'>program</span>. Mobile devices – smart phones and tablets – are <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='general purpose computer'>general purpose computers</span>. Like desktop and laptop computers, these general purpose computers can run different programs or apps. This contrasts with <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='special purpose computer'>special purpose computers</span> which can run only a single set <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='program'>program</span>. Examples of special purpose computers include a simple non-programmable calculator, a microwave oven, a smart thermostat, and a car's anti-lock braking system.
	</p>
    <h3>Binary Code</h3>
    <p>As you will learn in this lesson, computers understand binary code or <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='machine language'>machine language</span>. Binary code consists of 0s and 1s. One binary digit is called a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bit</span>. A group of eight bits is referred to as a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='byte'>byte</span>. One <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='byte'>byte</span> of memory takes about the same amount of memory as a character, such as the letter 't'. You will learn more about binary in future lessons, including how to convert binary numbers into decimal numbers and how to convert binary numbers into colors or characters.</p>

    :answer_a: low-level languages are easier for humans to understand
    :feedback_a: OK, so you didn’t get it right this time. Let’s look at this as an opportunity to learn. Try reviewing this information. High-level languages are easier for humans to understand.
    :answer_b: high-level languages provide abstractions that closely match the machine's architecture.
    :feedback_b: OK, so you didn’t get it right this time. Let’s look at this as an opportunity to learn. Try reviewing this information. This statement would be true of low-level machine languages.  High level languages are designed to make it easy of humans to program the computer. 
    :answer_c: high-level languages must be translated by software programs into low-level machine languages before then can be run on a computer
    :feedback_c: Correct.  For example, the blocks in our App Inventor apps have to be translated into machine language statements that can be understood by the CPU.  
    :answer_d: low-level languages cannot be understood by computers. 
    :feedback_d: OK, so you didn’t get it right this time. Let’s look at this as an opportunity to learn. Try reviewing this information. Computers can only understand their own low-level machine language.  Each type of CPU, such as Intel or Motorola, has its own machine language.
    :correct: c

    :feedback_b: 
    :answer_c: Any data stored in main memory disappears when the computer loses power. 
    :feedback_c: 
    :answer_d: It is the same as long-term memory. 
    :feedback_d: Mistakes are welcome here! Try reviewing this. Main memory is said to be <i>volatile</i> -- its contents are destroyed when the computer's power is turned off. So main memory is not long-term. &nbsp;An example of long-term memory would be the computer's disk drive.
    :correct: a,b,c

    Which of the following are true statements about a computer's main memory?

    :practice: T
    :answer_a: True
    :feedback_a: OK, so you didn’t get it right this time. Let’s look at this as an opportunity to learn. Try reviewing this information. This is actually the opposite case -- the computer's operating system software is sending information to a piece of hardware, the printer.
    :answer_b: False
    :feedback_b: That's right! This is an example of a computer's software sending information to the computer's hardware (the printer).  In this case, low level operating system software, such as device drivers and game controllers, manage the interface between the operating system and the corresponding hardware.
    :correct: b

    True or False: When printing a document the printer driver sends the document to the CPU which in turn sends the document to the printer to be printed. This is an example of the computer's hardware sending information to the computer's software.

      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Give an example of a &lt;i&gt;special purpose computer&lt;/i&gt; that you are familiar with and briefly describe its hardware and its software.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;As we learned in this lesson, a &lt;i&gt;byte&lt;/i&gt; is about the same amount of memory as a character, such as the letter &#39;t&#39;.  There are approximately 7 million characters in all of the Harry Potter novels combined. How many bytes of memory would all of the Harry Potter novels take up? How many copies of the Harry Potter novels would fit on a 7 Gigabyte flash drive. (Remember 1 Gigabyte is 1 billion bytes.)&lt;/li&gt;
