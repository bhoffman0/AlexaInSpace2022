Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p></p>
	In this unit, we have learned a number of important factors for building and using models.
    <ul>
    <li><i>abstraction</i> is used to remove extraneous details and focus the model on essential aspects of the problem.</li>
	<li><i>pseudorandomness</i> is used to model events, such as coin flips</li>
	<li>plan what the model represents and how it accomplishes that representation</li>
	<li>consider how the model can be used for making and testing hypotheses</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<div><b>Learning Objectives:</b>&nbspI will learn to</div>
		<ul>
		<li>describe the benefits of creating models and simulations</li>
		<li>compare and contrast models to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each</li>
		</ul>
		<div><b>Language Objectives:</b>&nbspI will be able to</div>
		<ul>
		<li>make hypotheses and predict outcomes of a simulation as well as describe experiment results</li>
		<li>use target vocabulary, such as model, simulation, and hypothesis to discuss how computers can mimic the real world, with the support of concept definitions and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YsJJ7IwEEpQGLqSizFhIFJVIw5TfDc5LqDtCSD-o42E/copy" target="_blank" title="">vocabulary notes</a> from this lesson</li>

	<h3>Solar System Models</h3>
    <p>Models and simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments (e.g., too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous).  Watch the following videos, paying particular attention to the different ways in which the models <i>abstract away</i> certain details from the real world situations that are being modeled. Discuss with your classmates which features of the solar system each model chose to include and to exclude. How do those choices align with the educational goals of each model?</p>

    <h4>Bill Nye's Model</h4>
    Bill Nye illustrates the problem of trying to build a <i><b>scale model</b></i> of the solar system by using his bicycle to demonstrate the relative sizes and the relative distances between the planets.

    <h4>7-Mile Long Scale Model</h4>
	Starting with an Earth the size of a marble, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/guys-build-amazing-7-mile-long-model-of-the-solar-system-to-scale/" target="_blank">these folks</a> built a full-scale model of our solar system across 7 miles of Nevada desert.

    <p>This simulation of <a href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/RabbitsAndWolves/" target="_blank"><b>rabbits and wolves</b></a> 
        shows how nature attempts to stay balanced. Read the Learner's Tab about how the simulation works and then complete 
        the following activities. (Note that this simulator works best in the Firefox browser).</p>
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">On the Activity tab, click Start Simulation. You can open the population graphs at any point to see how they 
          change over time. Record your groups observations about how the population of rabbits and wolves changed over time.
        </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>Hypothesis:</b> What would happen if there were lots more bunnies than there were wolves? Would the bunnies take over and live forever? <br/><b>Experiment:</b> Test the hypothesis by first resetting the simulation. Then click the View/Modify Parameters button followed by the View/Modify Start Parameters (Note that the View/Modify parameters button does not currently work in Chrome, but does work in Firefox). Adjust the settings to increase the initial number of rabbits. Record your observations. Did your prediction match with the results? How was it different than the first run of the simulation?</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><b>(Portfolio)</b> Reverse the hypothesis: What would happen if there were lots more wolves than there are bunnies? Would the wolves live forever? Record your hypothesis, prediction and       experiment results. (Don't forget to reset the simulation before changing the parameters.)</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Explain how the rabbits and wolves live in balance in this simulation.</li>
    <li><b>(Portfolio)</b> This model chose to include certain features and exclude other features. For example, this simulation only includes rabbits, wolves, and grass but there are other predators of rabbits and other food sources for rabbits. Why do you think the creators focused on these data elements and not others? How might this introduce <i>bias</i> (concentration on or interest in a particular area) into the simulation?</li>

    &lt;h3&gt;A Simulation Model of Global Climate&lt;/h3&gt;

    Atmospheric Administration 
    (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noaa.gov/climate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;).  
    It shows the predicted global temperature differences up through the year 2100.
    The animations show the time period 1970 to 2100. For each time level shown, the temperature differences (or anomalies) were 
    calculated by subtracting the model-simulated average for the years 1971 to 2000 from the time varying 21st century 
    model-projected temperatures. The change is in response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse 
    gases and aerosols based on a &quot;middle of the road&quot; estimate of future emissions. 
    
    &lt;p&gt;The animation starts off (1970s) showing most areas blue (-5 to -2 °F relative to the 1971-2000 average) 
    or yellow (+2 to +3.6 °F). By 2000, yellow begins to dominate. By 2050, most land areas have turned orange 
    or red (+5 to +11 °F), with most ocean areas yellow. By 2099, land areas are more reddish (+9 to +14 °F), with 
    most ocean areas yellow or orange.
