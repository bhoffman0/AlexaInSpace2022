# Alexa in Space

This is the Alexa in Space curriculum repository in development to port to the Runestone site.

The course contents are in html and rst are in the _sources directory. Assets such as images, js, css, lib/lessons are in the assets directory.

Quizly exercises are now handled by the new [Quizly directive](https://github.com/ram8647/RunestoneComponents). 

The rst source pages are generated automatically from Google Course Builder by the python script, util/gcb2rst.py.

The rst source is then compiled into html using [Runestone Components](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneComponents).
